###BunzContract
- A project created at University of Toronto's BlockFest Hackathon. The contract was used as a way to enforce dispute resolution on the Bunz platform (Bunz is a trading site which also offers the option of using their cryptocurrency, BTZ). The contract, which would be hosted on the Etherum network, details how exchange in BTZ's will be held in a time-locked wallet until both parties involved in the trade confirm selling/recieving the product. The buyer has the option of disputing a product if they believe they were misled in the condition of the product. The outcome of the dispute is managed by crowdsourced voting by other anonymous Bunz users. The contract then shall autonmously distribute the money  based on the outcome of votes.
